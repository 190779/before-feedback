					<h1>Covid: How a £20 gadget could save lives</h1>

					<p>One of the mysteries of Covid-19 is why oxygen levels in the blood can drop to dangerously low levels without the patient noticing.
					It is known as "silent hypoxia".As a result, patients have been arriving in hospital in far worse health than they realised and, in some cases, 
					too late to treat effectively.But a potentially life-saving solution, in the form of a pulse oximeter, allows patients to monitor their oxygen 
					levels at home, and costs about £20.They are being rolled out for high-risk Covid patients in the UK, and the doctor leading the scheme thinks 
					everyone should consider buying one.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card">
					<p>A normal oxygen level in the blood is between 95% and 100%."With Covid, we were admitting patients with oxygen levels
					in the 70s or low-or-middle 80s," said Dr Matt Inada-Kim, a consultant in acute medicine at Hampshire Hospitals.
					He told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health: "It was a really curious and scary presentation and really made us rethink what we were doing."
					Dr Inada-Kim became the national clinical lead of the Covid Oximetry@home project.
					Listen: Inside Health on oximeters on BBC Sounds A pulse oximeter slips over your middle finger and shines
					a light into the body. It measures how much of the light is absorbed in order to calculate oxygen levels in the blood.

					<h1>Coronavirus: How to get a Covid test <h1>

					<img src="image/covid test 1.jpg" height="25%" width="25%" alt ="covid test 1 img"/>
					<p>Should I get tested?
					Testing people and then tracing the contacts of those infected is vital to stop the disease from spreading.
					You should seek a test if you show one of these three key symptoms:
					a fever, a new continuous cough and a loss of smell or taste</p>
					
					<p>The idea of testing is to find people with the virus and keep them isolated to avoid it being spread through the wider community.

					Until you can get a test it's important you and your household self-isolate.

					What are coronavirus symptoms?
					Remember the R number? Why is it so important?
					How to get tested
					Go online, or call 119, before going to a drive-through or walk-through testing site - or a mobile testing unit
					Order a home testing kit in the first four days of having symptoms
